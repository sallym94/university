			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>A&S operates within the sector of online education or e-learning, and attempts to provide a new space for such learning to occur within. Each product consists of a piece of software designed to teach the user how to use one of many programming languages, allow them to code along with the lessons within the same interface, and provide them with projects and challenges to extend their knowledge. </p>

			<p>There are three tiers to the pricing of our products, an initial starter pack that is entirely free with no continued obligation, a standard monthly pack that contains a set amount of lessons, projects and challenges distributed weekly to you, and also an unlimited use pack which gives you unrestricted access to all features and content for a set one-time fee. If you complete and submit the challenge associated with the previous product, you will receive a discount on your next purchase.</p>

			<h2>Our History</h2>
			<p> A&S E-Learn, began in early 2015 with being officially launched in June. We began as A&S Learning in 1995; which was a community school that taught various computer related causes. We soon discovered that our students were learning more through our software than from us directly. So we decided to move completely online to open us to more customers. We are still available for face to face contact if you feel it is needed.</p>
